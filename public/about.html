<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Chayan, a man who will conquer web development. I'm a UC Berkeley Computer Science graduate, and it's now my time to contribute to the world!</p>

<p>I enjoy historical fencing and have been getting into kickboxing. I also enjoy video games, walks, and reading!</p>

<p>Can a person's life truly be accounted for in a single page? No! Therefore summaries are needed, but who determines what takes priority in this world of infinite information? What a concept unique to living beings.</p>
