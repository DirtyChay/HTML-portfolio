<h1>The Best Movies According to what Chayan's Recently Seen</h1>
<h2>The best (and only) three movie's I've seen this month!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Mario Movie</h3>
<p>
  A great movie for kids and long term Mario fans alike. Plenty of throwbacks
  that older fans will love, and plenty of scenes that will make everyone laugh.
  There is also plenty of hidden depth in the movie that a viewer might pick up
  on if they analyze the character motivations critically.
</p>

<h3>John Wick Chapter 4</h3>
<p>
  An action packed movie. John Wick is a machine as always. The movie also
  highlights the difference between fair-weathered friends and true friends,
  true friends will stick with you when it's hard.
</p>

<h3>Dungeons and Dragons Movie</h3>
<p>
  A fun and entertaining movie. Showcases several different classes and
  environments, and most of the characters have their own flaws they need to
  overcome.
